The `CreatePrimWithDefaultXform` command in Kit can create a Camera prim and you can optionally set camera attributes values during creation. You must use the attribute token names as the keys for the `attributes` dictionary. In Omniverse applications, you can explore the names by hovering over a property label in the Property Window and reading it from the tooltip.
