The `AddReference` command in Kit can add internal and external references to a prim.
``` {literalinclude} py_kit_cmds.py
:language: py
```

The `CreateReference` command is a convenient wrapper that creates an Xform prim and adds a Reference to it all at once.
``` {literalinclude} py_kit_cmds_var1.py
:language: py
```
