This is an example USDA result from creating an `Xform` and adding three `References` to it. The first referenced target prim is inside the current file with the prim path `/World/intern_target`. The second referenced target prim is in the file `C:/path/to/file.usd` with the prim path `/World/some/target` and the third is the default prim in the file `C:/path/to/other/file.usd`.
