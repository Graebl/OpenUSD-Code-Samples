The `CreatePayload` command is a convenient wrapper that creates an Xform prim and adds a Payload to it all at once. If you don't need the two steps batched together, you may want to :doc:`add-payload` to an existing prim via Kit Commands or USD Python API.

FIXME: how do i reference another code sample?
