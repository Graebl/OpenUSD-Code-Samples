You can use the `ChangeProperty` command from the `omni.kit.commands` extension to change the attribute of any prim. In Omniverse applications, you can discover the attribute name by hovering over the label in the Property Window and inspecting the tooltip.

You can find more information about the Kit command API at the [omni.kit.commands extension documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/omni.kit.commands/latest/API.html).
