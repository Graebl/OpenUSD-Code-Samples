# Convert Between VtArray and Numpy Array

Some Attributes store array type data which are accessed using the VtArray classes. You can find a list of the VtArray classes in our 

FIXME: USD Data Types documentation <../../quick-start/usd-types>`. 

If you need to manipulate the arrays using Python, it is advantageous to use Numpy to benefit from it's speed and efficiency. These snippets show how you can convert between the VtArray objects and Numpy Array objects.
