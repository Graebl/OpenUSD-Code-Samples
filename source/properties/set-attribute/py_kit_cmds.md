The `ChangeProperty` command allows users to undo the operation, but you must provide the value to use during the undo operation as the `prev` parameter.

``` {literalinclude} py_kit_cmds.py
:language: py
```

You can also set a timesample value at a particular time:

``` {literalinclude} py_kit_cmds_var1.py
:language: py
```
