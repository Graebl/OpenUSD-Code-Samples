FIXME:
If you want to find all of the prims of a certain type, you can `Traverse <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/api/class_usd_stage.html#adba675b55f41cc1b305bed414fc4f178>`_ the stage and use `Usd.Prim.IsA() <https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/api/class_usd_prim.html#a0a50d49f93140253633fa2e256a0e43f>`_ to compare the type of every prim on the stage with the type you are looking for.
