Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) Code Samples
========================================================

This is an index of code samples or snippets for Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). The code samples are indexed by topics and each code sample is titled by the task that it is used for. Where applicable, we include code samples using Kit OpenUSD wrappers for developing within Omniverse apart from the original USD API. New USD developers will find this useful for finding the appropriate API used to accomplish a task and using the `OpenUSD Python API reference <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/pxr-usd-api>`__ or `OpenUSD C++ API reference <https://openusd.org/release/api/index.html>`_ to learn more about the API. Experienced developers can use this index for quick code lookups.
